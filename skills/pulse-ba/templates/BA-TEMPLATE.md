# Business Analysis: {Title}

## 1. Problem (observed)

{What hurts today, for whom, how often. Quantify only with real
observations; "unknown" is a valid value.}

## 2. Who has it

{The affected users/roles in one or two sentences. Reference Project-BA
personas by ID when they exist; do not redefine them here.}

## 3. Solution hypothesis and strongest assumption

{One sentence solution hypothesis. How might we {goal} despite
{obstacle}?}
Assumption: {the one assumption that, if wrong, invalidates this BA.}

## 4. Scope

- In: {capability 1}, {capability 2}
- Out: {excluded 1}, {excluded 2}

## 5. Success signal and top risk

- Signal: {how we will notice it works; a number only if a baseline exists}
- Risk: {the biggest risk and its mitigation}
